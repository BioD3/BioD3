## About
**BioD3** is basically JavaScript library for "Scientific Data Visualisation", written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) & [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) by using a data visualisation framework, [d3](http://d3js.org/) (Data-Driven Documents). It's allow programmers to concentrate on their specific problems and avoid re-implementing the well-known algorithms and libraries.

## Philosophy
**BioD3** does what you tell it to do — no more, no less; _absolutely perfect_.

It doesn't mean, BioD3 is trying to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put it simply, BioD3 gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your valuable **scientific data**.

## Objective
